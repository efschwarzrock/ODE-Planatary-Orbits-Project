# ODE-Planatary-Orbits-Project
This program models orbits around a mass in space for my Ordinary Diferentail Equations class.

In adition to modeling just the orbit, it can also model an orbit when at some point a force is used to acelerate 
the object in a certain direction during a certain time period.

There are 3 example programs that show the function working, because finding nice numbers is somewhat chalenging.
The 2 main functions are 
 - orbitPlotter - this take the inital position of the object, the inital velocity of the object, the mass of the
                  object it is orbiting around and the time span to plot and plots the trajectory of the object
 - rocketPloter - this takes the inital position of the object, the inital velocity of the object, the mass of the
                  object it is orbiting around, the aceleration due to the rockets, the time when the rockets are 
                  going off, and the overall time period to plot.  It then plots the trajectory of the object.  The
                  black star is where the object started from, the green curve is the object's path befor the 
                  rockets started, the red curve is the path when the rockets were going off, and the blue curve is 
                  the path after the rockets stopped.
